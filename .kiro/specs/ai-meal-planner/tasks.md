## 🎯 AI Development Strategy

### Why We Can Move This Fast:
1. **Cursor AI** writes 80% of the code
2. **Component libraries** for UI (no pixel pushing)
3. **Firebase** handles all backend complexity
4. **Existing patterns** from completed features
5. **AI testing** catches bugs before we write them

### Daily Workflow:
- **Morning**: Plan the day's features with AI
- **Midday**: Rapid implementation with Cursor
- **Afternoon**: Test, iterate, and polish
- **Evening**: Deploy and prepare next day

### Code Generation Approach:
- Use AI to generate entire feature modules
- Copy patterns from existing code
- Let AI handle boilerplate and tests
- Focus human time on UX and strategy
