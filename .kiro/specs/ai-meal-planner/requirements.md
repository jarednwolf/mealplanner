# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Driven Meal Planning & Grocery Assistant is a revolutionary family food intelligence platform that goes beyond simple meal planning. The system learns and adapts to each family member's unique preferences, schedules, and behaviors, becoming an indispensable partner in managing the complex dynamics of modern family food life. By deeply understanding individual needs, contextual situations, and behavioral patterns, the platform eliminates daily meal stress while optimizing for health, budget, and family harmony. The core value proposition is transforming from reactive meal planning to proactive family food orchestration through true personalization and intelligent prediction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Individual Family Member Profiles and Deep Personalization

**User Story:** As a parent managing a busy household, I want the app to understand each family member as an individual with unique preferences, schedules, and needs, so that every meal suggestion considers everyone's happiness and health goals without requiring constant manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the app THEN the system SHALL provide an engaging, game-like onboarding that makes adding family members fun rather than a chore

4. WHEN suggesting meals THEN the system SHALL consider individual preferences and indicate which family members will enjoy each meal with a happiness prediction score
5. WHEN a family member's preferences change THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and adapt without requiring manual updates
6. IF a family member has conflicting preferences with others THEN the system SHALL find creative compromises or suggest customizable meals

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Context-Aware Meal Planning

### Requirement 3: Behavioral Learning and Implicit Feedback System
