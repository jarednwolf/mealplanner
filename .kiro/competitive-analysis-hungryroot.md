## Conclusion

Hungryroot has proven the market wants AI-powered meal planning. But they've also shown the limitations of a closed ecosystem with limited inventory. Our opportunity is to provide **true personalization** with **complete flexibility** at a **better price point**.

We're not competing for the same customer who wants everything delivered from a curated selection. We're serving the family who wants to shop smarter, save money, and still eat well - wherever they choose to shop.

Our competitive advantage isn't in controlling the supply chain - it's in being the intelligence layer that makes ANY supply chain work better for each unique family.
